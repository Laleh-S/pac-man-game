# Pac-Man Game
Link to the project: https://laleh-s.github.io/GA-Project-1

## Overview
In this project I had three weeks to build a grid base game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I was given a list of games to choose from. After going through the options, I decided to choose Pac-Man. Pac-Man, originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze action video game. 

**How it works:**
Pac-Man moves around a maze and eats all the dots inside while avoiding four  ghosts. When Pac-Man eats the large flashing dots the ghosts temporarily turn blue, which allow Pac-Man to eat them for bonus. The Ghosts also have the ability to catch Pac-Man which results in Pac-Man losing life and ending the game.


## Requirements
- Render a game in the browser
- Use JavaScript, CSS and HTML
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy the game using GitHub pages

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM
- Git
- GitHub Pages

## Planning and whiteboarding 
Although I played Pac-Man many times before, I never made the game. Therefore, I began researching to get an idea of the design pattern. After the  research, I had a better understanding of how the Pac-Man game really works behind the scenes. So I started thinking and planning about the functions and the features I would like to include in my game. Once I had a basic layout and features in mind I started with the whiteboarding. I have also planned the timeline and set a target for MVP.

## Timeline

**WEEK 1**  
- Decide which game to choose from
- Plan and whiteboard 
- Create the maze
- Add Pac-Man to the maze

How the maze works is that, all **0**s represent pac-dots, **1**s are walls, **2**s are the ghost house and **3**s are power-dots.

Creating the maze was fun.

function createGrid(maze) {
  removeAllChildNodes(grid)
  cells = []

  for ( let i = 0; i < maze.length; i++){
    const cell = document.createElement('div')
    grid.appendChild(cell)
    cells.push(cell)

    if (maze[i] === 0) {
      cells[i].classList.add('dots')
    } else if (maze[i] === 1) {
      cells[i].classList.add('walls')
    } else if (maze[i] === 2) {
      cells[i].classList.add('ghost-house')
    } else if (maze[i] === 3) {
      cells[i].classList.add('power-dots')
    } 
  }
}

After adding Pac-Man to the board, I had to make it able to move around the grid. Therefore, I created a function to move Pac-Man using keycodes. It worked well, but Pac-Man was faced to one direction at all times, even when it was moving up or down. I had to find a way of turning it head to different directions. I found that this could be fixed with some styling. Although I wanted to leave the styling for the third week, I decided to do this using CSS transform property. 

````
.pacman-up {
  -ms-transform: rotate(90deg); /* IE 9 */
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}

.pacman-right {
  -ms-transform: rotate(180deg); /* IE 9 */
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}

.pacman-down {
  -ms-transform: rotate(270deg); /* IE 9 */
  transform: rotate(270deg);
}

````
 
 **WEEK 2** 
 - Add ghosts to the maze
 - Make the ghosts move in different directions around the maze
 
 **Second challenge:**
 
 
 
 
 **WEEK 3** 
- MVP
- Add sounds
- Styling
