## Overview
In this project I had two weeks to build a grid base game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I was given a list of games to choose from. After going through the options, I decided to choose Pac-Man.


## Requirements
- Render a game in the browser
- Use JavaScript, CSS and HTML
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy the game using GitHub pages

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM
- Git
- GitHub Pages

## Planning
Although I played Pac-Man many times before, I never made the game. Therefore, I began researching to get an idea of the design pattern. This is a very helpful website I came across while I was searching: https://dev.to/code2bits/pac-man-patterns--ghost-movement-strategy-pattern-1k1a

After my research, I had a better understanding of how the Pac-Man game really works behind the scenes. So I started thinking about the functions and the features I would like to include in my game. Once I had a basic layout and features in mind I started with the whiteboarding.
