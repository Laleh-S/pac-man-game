# Pac-Man Game
Link to the project: https://laleh-s.github.io/GA-Project-1

## Overview
In this project I had two weeks to build a grid base game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I was given a list of games to choose from. After going through the options, I decided to choose Pac-Man. Pac-Man, originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze action video game. 

**How it works:**
Pac-Man moves around a maze and eats all the dots inside while avoiding four  ghosts. When Pac-Man eats the large flashing dots the ghosts temporarily turn blue, which allow Pac-Man to eat them for bonus. The Ghosts also have the ability to catch Pac-Man which results in Pac-Man losing life and ending the game.


## Requirements
- Render a game in the browser
- Use JavaScript, CSS and HTML
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy the game using GitHub pages

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM
- Git
- GitHub Pages

## Planning
Although I played Pac-Man many times before, I never made the game. Therefore, I began researching to get an idea of the design pattern. After the  research, I had a better understanding of how the Pac-Man game really works behind the scenes. So I started thinking and planning about the functions and the features I would like to include in my game. Once I had a basic layout and features in mind I started with the whiteboarding. I have also planned the timeline and set a target for MVP.
